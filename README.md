[![Status: Learning Completed (for now!)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Learning%20Completed%20(for%20now!)-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Taoshif1/LearningTS)

Welcome to my **React Journey** — this repo documents my personal learning progress, practice files and small experiments while learning React.js. From forms to components, state management and styling — this is where it all started as a part of my MERN Stack journey.

> **Course Completed ✔️**  
> Still updating this repo with more advanced topics like **React Routing**, **Hooks** and real-world projects. Stay tuned.

## 🏆  Hackathon Project: From Chains to Freedom

The skills and concepts learned in this repository were put to the test in the Bolt Devpost Hackathon. Our team built "From Chains to Freedom," a historical website developed entirely with React.

> 🔗 [Live Site](https://fromchainstofreedom.netlify.app)  
> 🧠 Built for: **Bolt DevPost Hackathon: Hackstory**  
> 💡 Description: A powerful historical storytelling web app built using **React.js** and deployed with **Netlify**.

This was my **first real React project** and it proved to me that I’m capable of turning theory into actual results — from concept to production. 💪
